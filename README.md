<b>Installation</b>

pip install -e .

<b>Instructions</b>

Files:

- gym_CTgraph: folder with the CT-graph code.

- test_graph.py: script to the perform basic tests of the CT-graph environments.

- testDimRed.py: script to perform checks on the input image dataset, e.g. dimensionality reduction and visualization with t-SNE.

- ilearn.py: simple script to perform classification on the input image dataset.

Using tensorboad:
tensorboard --logdir='./logs' --port=6707
